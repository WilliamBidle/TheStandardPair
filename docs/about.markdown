  Welcome to my website! I am currently a Ph.D. student at Stony Brook University studying quantum physics in the <a href="http://qit.physics.sunysb.edu/wordpress/" target = "_blank">Quantum Information Science & Technology</a> group under Dr. Eden Figueroa. I have a passion for data visualization and machine learning, and some of my work can be found under the <a href="/programming-projects" title="Programming Projects">Programming Projects</a> tab as well as my <a href="https://github.com/WilliamBidle" target = "_blank">Github</a>. I also really love listening to music and occasionally review some of my favorite albums and artist under the <a href="/lets-talk-music" title="Let's Talk Music Projects">Let's Talk Music</a> tab.
