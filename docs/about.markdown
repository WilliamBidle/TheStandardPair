  Welcome to my website! I am currently a Ph.D. student at Stony Brook University studying quantum physics in the <a href="http://qit.physics.sunysb.edu/wordpress/" target = "_blank">Quantum Information Science & Technology</a> group under Dr. Eden Figueroa. I have a passion for data visualization and machine learning, and some of my work can be found under the Programming Projects tab.
