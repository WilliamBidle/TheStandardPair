  Welcome to my personal website! I have a passion for data visualization, machine learning, and physics, and some of my work can be found under the <a href="/programming-projects" title="Programming Projects">Programming Projects</a> tab as well as on my <a href="https://github.com/WilliamBidle" target = "_blank">Github</a>. Some of my written work for these projects and other research I have done can be found under the <a href="/research-and-writing" title="Research and Writing">Research and Writing</a> tab. I also really love listening to music and occasionally review some of my favorite albums and artist under the <a href="/lets-talk-music" title="Let's Talk Music Projects">Let's Talk Music</a> tab. You can download my CV <a href="/assets/CV.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
