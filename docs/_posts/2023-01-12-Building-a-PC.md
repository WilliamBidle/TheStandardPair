For several years I had really wanted to build my own PC, but never really got around doing it... until now! I decided to finally go through with it as a graduation gift to myself and wanted to document some of the process as well as the results. I owe a lot of thanks to my good friend Vineeth Vattikuti for helping to assemble a parts list as well as teaching me how to actually put it all together.

# Putting it Together

For the most part, the process is really just paying close attention to the instruction manuals, and when in a bind, resorting to some helpful YouTube videos such as this one.

And there you have it!
