 I recently just finished up my Master's Degree in Physics at Stony Brook University and wanted to summarize some of the work I had done during my time there. All of the code for the project can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/WilliamBidle/Quantum-State-Estimation" target = "_blank">Github</a>.

More Coming Soon!
