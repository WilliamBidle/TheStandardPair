If you have ever had any experience with machine learning in Python its pretty likely you've heard of <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" target = "_blank">TensorFlow</a>. In essence, TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence in Python that modularizes the process into simple building block-like style. It allows for complex neural networks to be built in just a few lines:

with so many different hyperparameters to choose from. 


 It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks.

This project was done in collboration with <a href="https://ilanazane.github.io/" target = "_blank">Ilana Zane</a>, and the code for the project can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/WilliamBidle/Fun-with-Autoencoders/blob/master/Fun_with_Autoencoders.ipynb" target = "_blank">Github</a>.
