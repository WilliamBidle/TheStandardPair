Sven Gamsky, better known as Still Woozy, has proven himself as an incredibly talented and compelling solo artist. His combination of smooth vocals and creative writing help to define a fresh and exciting sound that is hard to come by. While Gamsky has yet to produce a full studio album, his discography hosts an impressive list of indie and alternative hits that are slowly bringing him into the spotlight. 

From the sunset vibes of “Goodie Bag” to the bizarre, yet groovy “Lava,” Gamsky has created a really unique formula for success, and seems incapable of releasing a bad song. Almost all of his tracks are under 3 minutes, and are guaranteed to leave you craving more. What’s more, Gamsky insists on self-producing all of his work, trying to focus on the messages he wants to send instead of popularity. 

During the pandemic Gamsky has used the isolation as a way to fuel his creative process, giving him more time to work on his music. In fact, some of my favorite tracks come from work he has released this past year, including the bright and soulful “Window,” the deep and more introspective “BS,” as well as his latest track and an absolute vibe, “Rocky.” He hits topics ranging from struggles of falling and staying in love, to being caught up in feelings of anger and confusion, things that everyone can relate to.

One of the more unique things about Still Woozy is the ever-interesting album art covers. Gamsky’s fiancé, Amiya Kahn-Tietz, creates the art for all of his singles, each piece featuring abstract human-like figures that further define his brand. His website even features a free downloadable coloring book for art from his EP, Lately. 

Even with such a select few tracks to his name, Gamsky has found a sound that really works for his style and continues to show major potential as a future big name in the music industry. Whether you like dreamy vocals, a groovy chorus, or just an overall great vibe, you’re guaranteed great music with Still Woozy. Hopefully Gamsky’s talent continues to become more recognized as he moves forward with his career, and I’m excited to see what he has in store for the future.
