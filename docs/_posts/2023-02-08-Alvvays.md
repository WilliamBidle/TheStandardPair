I have been absolutely obsessed with this band lately. Alvvays is the perfect love child of indie pop and 80's rock, and would easily dominate the charts with more recognition. They have the incredible ability to consistantly put out good music across different albums, and I am hoping to showcase some of their music here in this post. I look forward to seeing where they end up in the future as they continue to evolve and find their style.

Alvvays' first, self-titled album was released in 2014 is as close as you can get to a perfect introduction into the talent of a band. I don't think there is a better way to start an album off than with _Adult Diversion_, easily one of my all-time favorite songs. Lead singer Molly Rankin's vocals immediately hook you, as her nonchalant vocal style pairs extremely well with the jangly guitars and roaring bass. The song is about having an unhealthy obsession with someone, which is pretty ironic considering how easy it is to become obsessed with the song itself. 

The album's next song, _Archie, Marry Me_, is easily the band's most popular song. While the song comes across as light and romantic, it actually discusses some of the complex and unrealistic expectations to marry early and live lives that others expect you to. The song is supposedly following the early relationship of Rankin and guitarist Alec O'Hanley, and the expectations of them to marry so early on.

_Atop a Cake_ continues to explore the theme of the complexities of marriage and matrimony. The song is a fantastic example of the band's ability to discuss a deep topic while absolutely jamming out. For such an upbeat and groovy song, it's actually tells quite a depressing story. Rankin sings that "you'd like us on top of a cake but you won't let me take a bite," which is very clearly an insight into a one-sided relationship, where their significant other won't let them have any input into a marriage they may not even want.

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:30px; font-style: bold;">Anitsocialites (2017)</p>

<br>

It's always a difficult task to follow up such a strong first album, and many times artists can easily fall short of heavy expectations. While Antisocialites doesn't follow the exact formula as their previous album, the band managed to refine their sound and Rankin's vocals feel much more confident this time around. The opening tracks, _In Undertow_ and _Dreams Tonight_ explore the ideas of nostalgia and living life as though it were a dream, with a much more mellow vibe than the previous album's opening tracks. 

However the mood immediate changes with their next track, _Plimsoll Punks_, and they practically pick right back up where they left off on the previous album with their funky indie pop style. After listening to this track a few times, you'll be feeling like a plimsol punk yourself. 

Some of my other favorites off of the album are _Lollipop_, _Your Type_, and _Hey_.

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:30px; font-style: bold;">Blue Rev (2022)</p>

<br>

5 years is a long time to wait for new music from your favorite band, and very rarely do they ever come back sounding exactly as they had before. If you had someone listen to _Blue Rev_ and compared it to any of the band's previous albums, you may not even be able to recognize them as coming from the same band. Alvvays really redefined their style in their 5 year hiatus, and most certainly succeeded with what they found in a much louder and passionate sound.

Rankin's vocal style also takes a huge turn throughout this album. She better showcases her range and passion for singing in songs such as _After the Earthquake_, which talks about the humanizing effect that natural disasters can have on us.

_Pressed_ is easily the band's most interesting song to date. It brings a ton of energy right off the bat, and sounds unlike anything else they've put out before. The band's influence from The Smiths is in full force on this track, and Rankin sounds like an alternate timeline version of Morrisey. The song's only flaw is that it is way too short. 

While the band still deserves way more popularity, they are starting to gain some great recognition, most notably when they headlined for The Tonight Show. I am really looking forward to see what lies in store for Alvvays in the future.
