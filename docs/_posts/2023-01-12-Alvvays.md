I have been absolutely obsessed with this band lately. Alvvays is the perfect love child of indie pop and 80's rock, and would easily dominate the charts with more recognition. They have the incredible ability to consistantly put out good music across different albums, and I am hoping to showcase some of their music here in this post. I look forward to seeing where they end up in the future as they continue to evolve and find their style. 

#  **Alvvays (2014)**

The band's first, self-titled album was released in 2014 is as close as you can get to a perfect introduction into the talent of a band. I don't think there is a better way to start an album off than with _Adult Diversion_, easily one of my all-time favorite songs. Lead singer Molly Rankin's vocals immediately hook you. Her nonchalant vocal style is extremely intriguing and pairs very well with . The song is about having an unhealthy obsession with someone, which is pretty ironic considering how easy it is to become obsessed with the song itself. 

The album's next song, _Archie, Marry Me_, is easily the band's most popular song. While the song comes across as light and romantic, it actually discusses some of the complex and unrealistic expectations to marry early and live lives that others expect you to. The song is supposedly following the relationship of Rankin and guitarist Alec O'Hanley.

Similar to _Archie, Marry Me_, _Atop a Cake_ continues to explore the complexities of marriage and matrimony. The song is a fantastic example of the band's ability to discuss complex topics while absolutely jamming out.

# **Anitsocialites (2017)**

It's always a difficult task to follow up such a strong first album, and many times artists can easily fall short of heavy expectations. While Antisocialites doesn't follow the exact formula as their previous album, the band certainly delivers on some extremely ... The opening tracks, _In Undertow_ and _Dreams Tonight_, don't bring as much energy as , but it is clear from the beginning that the band is trying a new style. 

However the mood immediate changes with their next track, _Plimsoll Punks_, and they pick right back up where they left off on the previous album. 

Some of my other favorites off of the album are _Lollipop_, _Your Type_, and _Hey_.

5 years is a long time to wait for new music from your favorite band, but with Alvvays, it is always worth the wait (pun most definitely intended). 

Alvvays is really tapping into their Smith's influences in this album with absolute masterpieces such as _After the Earthquake_ and _Pressed_. Jangly guitars and etherial vocals
